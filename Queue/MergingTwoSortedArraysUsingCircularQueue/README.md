# Explanation:

CircularQueue Structure: Contains the array, pointers for front and rear, and the capacity.
initializeQueue: Initializes the front and rear pointers to -1 to indicate an empty queue.
isFull and isEmpty: Utility functions to check if the queue is full or empty.
enqueue: Adds an element to the queue and updates the rear pointer.
dequeue: Removes an element from the queue and updates the front pointer.
mergeSortedArrays: Merges the two sorted arrays and enqueues elements in sorted order into the queue.
main: Initializes the arrays and calls the merge function, displaying the merged queue.

# Key Points:

The queue size must be large enough to hold all elements from both arrays.
This code assumes no overflow handling beyond basic checks. For larger arrays, increase SIZE or use dynamic memory.
